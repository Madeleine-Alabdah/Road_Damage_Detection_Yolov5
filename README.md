# Road_Damage_Detection_Yolov5

This project aims to detect the potholes and cracks along the roads using Yolov5. The model was retrained to recognize new types of road problems. The dataset is "China_MotorBike". Then we make our dataset, annotate each image, and cluster it to the appropriate label. The model achieved very good detection and labeling. There's an intuition to develop it by adding more labels and using data augmentation.
